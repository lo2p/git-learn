# Git Workflow

The typical Git workflow involves three main areas:

1. Local (Working Directory)

- This is where your files live on your local machine. It's the directory you're working in, where you make changes to your code, documents, etc.
- Add, edit, or delete files.

2. Staging Area

- A temporary area where Git records your changes before you commit them (preview of next commit).
- You "stage" your changes using git add, which tells Git to include those changes in the next commit.

3. Repository

- The permanent store of your project. It's where all the committed changes are stored, tracked, and managed.
- You commit your changes (with git commit), which moves them from the staging area to the repository.
